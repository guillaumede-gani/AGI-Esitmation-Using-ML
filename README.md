# Pulse Wave Analysis Using Machine Learning

This repositorie is a resume of the work I did on Photophletismography (PPG) waves during my month and a half position in a health tech compagnie. The idea of this project was to measure the Age Index as described in [[1]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.hyp.32.2.365?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) on poor quality PPG waves measured by a finger Oximiter.
